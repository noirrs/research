## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The intersection of computer vision and sports analytics has emerged as a transformative field, enabling unprecedented insights into player performance, tactical analysis, and game strategy. Traditional sports analysis relied heavily on manual observation and subjective interpretation, which was time-consuming, prone to human error, and limited in scope. The advent of advanced computer vision techniques, particularly deep learning-based object detection and tracking algorithms, has revolutionized this domain by enabling automated, objective, and comprehensive analysis of sports footage.

Football (soccer), being the world's most popular sport, presents unique challenges for automated analysis due to its dynamic nature, multiple moving objects, occlusions, and varying camera perspectives. This research examines a comprehensive football video analysis system that addresses these challenges through an integrated pipeline of computer vision algorithms, validated through rigorous manual annotation and benchmarked against existing industrial solutions.

### 1.2 System Overview and Validation Approach

The analyzed system represents a complete football video analysis solution that processes raw match footage to extract meaningful insights including player detection and tracking, team classification, ball possession analysis, performance metrics calculation, camera movement compensation, spatial analysis, and interactive visualization. The system's performance has been rigorously evaluated through manual annotation of 1,870 frames across 10 test videos using a custom-developed frame labeling tool, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.50%, demonstrating the practical viability of the automated analysis pipeline.

## 2. System Architecture and Design

### 2.1 Overall Pipeline Architecture

The system follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture that processes video data through distinct stages: raw video input, object detection, multi-object tracking, camera movement estimation, position adjustment, view transformation, team assignment, ball possession analysis, speed/distance calculation, and visualization output. This design ensures modularity, where each component can be developed, tested, and optimized independently; scalability, allowing additional analysis modules to be integrated without affecting existing functionality; maintainability, with clear separation of concerns facilitating debugging and enhancement; flexibility, enabling different algorithms to be substituted within each module; and validation-readiness, with the modular design enabling component-wise evaluation and performance assessment.

### 2.2 Core Components Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Object Detection Module (YOLO Implementation)

The object detection module employs a custom-trained YOLOv8 model stored in `models/best.pt`, capable of detecting four classes: Player, Referee, Ball, and Goalkeeper (with the latter converted to Player during processing). The system uses a confidence threshold of 0.1, optimized for recall over precision, and implements batch processing of 20-frame batches for computational efficiency. Key features include pre-trained weights initialization from YOLOv8x, custom dataset training on football-specific scenarios, goalkeeper class remapping to handle training data limitations, and batch processing optimization for video analysis.

The training pipeline includes comprehensive infrastructure with Roboflow dataset integration for automated data management, YOLOv5xu as baseline with 100 epochs training, structured data organization with train/test/validation splits, and automated model evaluation and performance metrics.

#### 2.2.2 Multi-Object Tracking System

The system employs ByteTrack, a state-of-the-art multi-object tracking algorithm that excels in handling high-confidence detections as primary tracking targets, low-confidence detections for recovered tracks of missed objects, trajectory management to maintain consistent IDs across frames, and occlusion handling for robust performance during player overlap. The tracking strategy implements full ByteTrack for players and referees with ID consistency, simplified tracking for the ball (ID=1) due to its unique characteristics, position calculation using foot position for players and center position for the ball, and interpolation with ball position smoothing using Akima interpolation.

#### 2.2.3 Camera Movement Compensation

The camera movement compensation module implements Lucas-Kanade optical flow with carefully tuned parameters including a 15×15 pixel search window, 2 pyramid levels, and termination criteria of EPS|COUNT with 10 iterations and 0.03 accuracy threshold. Feature selection focuses on field edges within x-coordinates 0-20 and 990-1050 pixels, with quality thresholding at 0.3 for corner detection reliability and minimum 3-pixel distance between features to avoid clustering. The system tracks up to 100 corner features per frame, identifies maximum movement vectors from all tracked features, applies movement compensation to all detected objects, and stores movement data for visualization and analysis.

#### 2.2.4 Perspective Transformation System

The system implements multiple coordinate transformation approaches, beginning with a standard view transformer that maps pixel coordinates to real-world meters using source vertices at positions [[110,1035], [260,275], [910,260], [1640,915]] and target vertices at [[0,68], [0,0], [23.32,0], [23.32,68]]. The improved view transformer expands the mapping area by 1.8 times for enhanced player capture at field edges, includes a 100-pixel boundary tolerance for transformation robustness, optimizes linear scaling for better player positioning, and implements safety clamping to ensure coordinates remain within field boundaries.

The coordinate converter module handles standard field dimensions of 105m × 68m according to FIFA regulations, provides flexible scaling for different visualization requirements, enables bidirectional conversion between real-world and pixel coordinates, and preserves aspect ratio for geometric accuracy.

### 2.3 Team Classification Algorithm

#### 2.3.1 K-Means Clustering Implementation

The team classification employs a two-stage clustering approach. First, individual player color extraction crops the player bounding box from the frame, focuses on the upper half for jersey region analysis, applies K-means clustering (k=2) to separate player from background, and uses corner pixel analysis to identify the background cluster. Second, team color assignment collects representative colors from all detected players, applies K-means clustering (k=2) to group players into teams, and assigns consistent team colors throughout the match.

Technical details include optimized parameters with K-means initialization using 'k-means++' and n_init=1, jersey region cropping to the top half of player images, and robustness features such as spatial fallback mechanisms for field position-based team assignment when color analysis fails, consistent tracking of player-team assignments across frames, and automatic imbalance detection with correction for skewed team distributions.

#### 2.3.2 Ball Possession Analysis

The ball possession analysis implements distance-based assignment with a maximum distance threshold of 70 pixels for ball-player association, multi-point measurement calculating distance to both feet positions, minimum distance selection for ball assignment to the closest eligible player, and temporal consistency maintenance during uncertain possession frames.

## 3. Empirical Validation and Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Manual Annotation Framework

A sophisticated frame labeling application was developed using PySide6 to enable systematic manual annotation, providing a native GUI performance framework with object-oriented design and real-time frame sampling capabilities. The interface includes video frame extraction and display, adjustable sampling percentage (demonstrated at 24.93% actual usage), real-time accuracy calculation and display, previous choices dashboard for quality control, CSV export functionality for statistical analysis, and keyboard shortcuts for efficient labeling.

The sampling methodology utilized systematic sampling with every 4th frame selected for comprehensive coverage, achieving 24.93% sampling rate from 1,870 labeled frames out of 7,500 total frames (25fps × 30 seconds × 10 videos). This approach ensures temporal coverage with approximately 187 frames per 30-second video segment, maintains quality control through visible previous choices for consistency checking, and provides statistical significance through large sample size evaluation.
